To Do
	Add line numbers to all error output in cylogos.py
	Add support for filters (and apps other than springboard) (no filter = springboard maybe?) (maybe line starting with "###" at the top of the file)
	Change loader MS filter to load into all processes with UIKit instead of just springboard (once filters are implemented)
	Test on something more modern than iOS 6

Maybe
	Add support for C function hooking? (%hookf)
	Support changes to files/re-hooking without killing the process (maybe not possible)
	Remove temporary files in destructor in loader?
	Support for reloading files when they're changed on disk (using file system events) (maybe not the best idea since people save frequently before they're done editing)
	Add option to show UIAlertView on error syntax/parsing error (for beginners)
	Rewrite parser in something other than python... (cycript?(lol) bash? perl?(ew))
